# blahblah

This is the dumbest slowest database ever. If you are going to use it for smart fast purposes, it will disappoint you. 

The reason I waste my time writing it is I need to store some values across many different scripts and computers and cannot and won't bother setting up a real database with authentication and blah blah. Also, I use it to make mock REST API JSON responses.

Feel free to blah blah your data here.
